## Accessibility Report: PixPaint

### Principles of Universal Design

#### Equitable Use

PixPaint is designed to be a pixel art program that can be easily used
by anyone who installs the program. The simple canvas grid and tool panel
layout is the same for anyone who uses the program, and all 
users have access to the same security provisions for storing their
drawing data through our sign up and login functionality.

#### Flexibility in Use

By nature of being a drawing program, PixPaint is flexible depending on 
however the user wishes to create their art. The brush and eraser tools
are all the user needs to create any variety of pixel art they would like,
and our color palette selector function allows them to further customize the
colors they would like to use. The save and load features allow the user to
work at their own pace, coming back to a saved project later.

#### Simple and Intuitive Use

We have taken extra care to ensure that PixPaint is simple and intuitive to
use, making sure to avoid unnecessary functions and clutter in the tool and canvas
panels. Where possible, as with the brush and eraser buttons, we have used 
icons that can universally communicate their function rather than words, which allows
reduces barriers to use for users of different languages. The most important program
information for the user to understand always has the largest GUI components: the canvas
is the largest part of the screen, followed by the color palette where the user can
choose their colors, and then the brush and eraser tools.

#### Perceptible Information

We have maximized the legibility of essential information such as the canvas, color palette,
and brush and eraser tools by making their graphics components larger and immediately visually
understandable. They are distinguished from the surrounding gray backdrop through their button
borders and labels or icons, and labels and icons are large and high-contrast compared to their 
surroundings so that they can easily be perceived. The simple design with a lack of unnecessary
extra buttons guides the user towards only the essential information. However, we could improve
the program's accessibility to those with sensory or other limitations by using different modes
to present information, perhaps by adding a voice narration to indicate the buttons and color options.

#### Tolerance for Error

PixPaint allows users to quickly undo mistakes via the eraser button and color selection tools. If
a user accidentally clicks the wrong square or colors a square in with the wrong color, they can simply
either erase it or replace it with the correct color. Similarly, our load and save functions allow the users
to back up their drawings in case they make a lot of mistakes and want to return to an earlier version. 
If the user makes a mistake during the signup, login, save, or load processes such that the program is
unable to perform the function the user intends for it to do, the program immediately alerts the user 
about the mistake that was made and what caused it.

#### Low Physical Effort

PixPaint can be used on any Windows or Mac laptop or desktop computer, and as such allows the user to
maintain a neutral body position with minimal effort, as they can simply sit and work on their drawings
at the computer. Accordingly, PixPaint also requires minimal physical force or prowess to operate and as
such minimizes sustained physical effort while using the program. However, we can further improve on this
by adding the ability for the user to color multiple squares by clicking and dragging, reducing the repetitive 
physical action of clicking on individual squares to color them in.

#### Size and Space for Approach and Use

PixPaint provides adequate space for use, and is adjustable based on user preferences, as they are able to
adjust the size of the PixPaint window. The PixPaint window provides the user a clear line of sight to all 
tools necessary to create their pixel art, and the window can be traversed with minimal mouse movement.

### Target Demographic

If PixPaint were to be marketed as a pixel drawing tool, the target consumer
demographic would be digital art hobbyists. People who would like to try doing 
pixel art but do not have access to or expertise in more complex, professional-grade
programs will likely enjoy the simple and effective interface PixPaint provides for
creating a wide variety of pixel art. More specifically, people who are starting 
out in trying to make their own retro-style games may enjoy using PixPaint, as it 
provides an easy-to-use interface for those who may not
be familiar with digital art and allows them to create pixel sprites
for their game with minimal effort in learning how to use a complex drawing
program - PixPaint even exports drawings as pngs with
transparent backgrounds, making it suitable for use in producing 
such game assets.

### Demographics less likely to use PixPaint

Those with visual impairments or motor impairments may struggle to use PixPaint
due to its reliance on visual information and the repetitive fine-tuned movements
required to continuously color in the desired squares on the canvas. PixPaint is not
a program designed to address these limitations according to the medical model of 
disability, and in its current state does not adequately accommodate these concerns 
under the social model of disability either. As mentioned in the Principles of Design
section, areas for improvement include presenting information in non-visual modes, such 
as having a voice narration option, and providing compatibility for assistive technology.
